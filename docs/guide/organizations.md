How to Share Cases with Organization Members

2. **Import Organization Members**: Use the "Import from Organization" feature to invite your entire organization or specific members to the group
3. **Share Cases**: Navigate to the Cases and enable case sharing within the group to collaborate on documents, reports, and contacts
4. **Set Access Permissions**: Control what organization members can view and edit in shared cases

Groups provide the collaborative workspace where organization members can work together on cases with appropriate access controls and permissions.
