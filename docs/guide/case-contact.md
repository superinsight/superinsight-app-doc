    Use the dropdown to switch between these two options.

    • Select **User** to share with one person.

=== "Enter Email"
    If you've selected User, enter the email address of the person you want to invite.

Once shared

After sharing, all invited users or groups will be listed under the "Who has access to this case?" section.  
You can remove access anytime if needed.

#### Access Control

You can customize access levels for each user or group by using the **Access Control** feature.

This ensures that collaborators only see and edit what they're authorized to handle.

=== "Set Access"
    Next to each person listed in the **Who has access to this case?** section, you'll find a **gear icon**.  
    Click this icon to open the Access Control dialog and manage permissions.

=== "Set Permissions"
    In the Access Control dialog, you can assign different access levels to individual parts of the case including **Documents**, **Reports**, and **Contact**.

    For each part, choose one of the following roles:

    - **Read** – View-only access. The user can see the content but cannot make any changes.  
    - **Write** – Full access to view, edit, and update content.  
    - **None** – The user has no access to this section.

    These settings can be customized per person. Click **Update** to save your changes.

    > Example: You might allow a reviewer to read Documents but restrict them from accessing Contacts.
