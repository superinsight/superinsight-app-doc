# Manage Documents

## Overview

The **Documents** section provides a comprehensive file management system with two main organizational areas:

- **My Documents**: A personal workspace for your own file uploads and organization
- **Case Documents**: A dedicated space for files that are linked to specific cases

This updated layout offers better organization and clearer separation between personal files and case-related documents.

## Navigation

Access the Documents section from the left-hand sidebar. The Documents tab is prominently displayed and provides easy access to both your personal documents and case-related files.
