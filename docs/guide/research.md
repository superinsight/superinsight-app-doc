# Manage Research

## Overview

The **Research** feature is a powerful AI-powered tool that allows you to query your uploaded documents using natural language. This feature enables you to extract insights, find specific information, and get contextual answers from your document collection without manually searching through files.

You can ask questions such as:

- "Summarize this file"
- "What are the key points in this report?"
- "What happened on this date?"
- "Find all mentions of specific medical conditions"
- "Compare the findings between these documents"

The Research feature provides intelligent, context-aware responses based on the content of your selected documents.

### Getting Responses

The Research feature will analyze your selected documents and provide contextual answers. Please note that processing may take up to one minute as the AI thoroughly analyzes your documents to provide accurate and comprehensive responses:

=== "AI Response"
    The system processes your question and returns relevant information from your documents.

=== "References"
    Responses include references to specific parts of your documents for verification. When you **click on a source link** in the AI response, the referenced document **opens in a panel** on the right side, showing the exact page and location where the information was found. This allows you to **verify the AI's answers** against the original source material.
