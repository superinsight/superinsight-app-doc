# Manage Research

## Overview

The **Research** feature is a powerful AI-powered tool that allows you to query your uploaded documents using natural language. This feature enables you to extract insights, find specific information, and get contextual answers from your document collection without manually searching through files.

You can ask questions such as:

- "Summarize this file"
- "What are the key points in this report?"
- "What happened on this date?"
- "Find all mentions of specific medical conditions"
- "Compare the findings between these documents"

The Research feature provides intelligent, context-aware responses based on the content of your selected documents.

## How to Use

## Best Practices

### Effective Questioning
- **Be Specific**: Ask targeted questions for more precise answers
- **Use Natural Language**: Write questions as you would ask a colleague
- **Reference Context**: Mention specific dates, names, or events when relevant
- **Follow Up**: Use previous answers to ask more detailed follow-up questions

### File Selection
- **Relevant Documents**: Select only the documents relevant to your research question
- **Multiple Sources**: Include multiple files for comprehensive analysis
- **Case Context**: Use case-specific documents for case-related research
- **Personal Files**: Include personal documents for broader context when needed

The Research feature transforms your document collection into an intelligent knowledge base, enabling you to quickly find information, extract insights, and make informed decisions based on your uploaded content.
