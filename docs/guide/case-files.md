# Manage File

## Upload Files

Depending on the purpose, you can upload files that support your legal claims to the folders you have created after navigating to the folder level.

!!! TIP
    We now support ZIP file uploads! You can compress multiple files into a single ZIP file and upload them at once. The maximum file size is 2GB.

Click the upload button on the left and select the files to upload. Once you submit the files, a small window will appear in the bottom-right corner of the screen, displaying your file upload progress.

After the files are uploaded, you will see them in the folder with a red processing icon on the right. These files cannot be clicked on at this stage. Behind the scenes, Superinsight is processing the content of your files. Depending on the size of your files, this process can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours.

## File Labeling

During file processing, your files will be automatically labeled. Superinsight categorizes all files by type, allowing you to easily find specific files using the filter feature.

In addition to auto-labeling, you can manually add or remove labels from files as needed.

    Click on the label icon to manage labels for this file.
