## Share My Cases

After creating a group and adding members, you can share your cases with the entire group for collaborative work.

    Enable the **"Share all my cases with this group"** toggle at the bottom of the group page to automatically share all current and future cases with group members. The access control dialog appears automatically after enabling the toggle, or you can **click the gear icon** on the right to access it anytime.

=== "Access Control"
    Set appropriate **access permissions** for group members to control what they can view and edit in shared cases.

    In the Access Control dialog, you can assign different access levels to individual parts of the case including **Documents**, **Reports**, and **Contact**.

    For each part, choose one of the following roles:

    - **Read** – View-only access. The user can see the content but cannot make any changes.
    - **Write** – Full access to view, edit, and update content.
    - **None** – The user has no access to this section.
