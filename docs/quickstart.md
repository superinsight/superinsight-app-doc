## 2. Upload a File

Depending on the purpose, you can upload files that can help your legal claims to the folders you created or Superinsight prepared and organized for you.

After you upload the file, you can see a little window at the right-down corner of the screen showing your file upload progress.

As the file is uploaded, you will see it in the folder as a gray color and can not be clicked on. Behind the scenes, Superinsight processes all the contents of your file. Depending on how large your files are, this process can take a few minutes to hours.
